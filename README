WIP modding M910 2.6.32 Vital & InstintcQ files to work with Jet / S8000 for 2.6.39.5 kernel.

This files can build a working zImage except for video that starts and then fails / phone shuts 
down dew to ams320* and 24bit instead of ams310* and 16bit.

Hopefully witht his files the conversion should be easier to complete.
